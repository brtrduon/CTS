You need npm (or some other equivalent JavaScript package manager such as Yarn) to install the dependencies prior to running.

TO INSTALL:
-cd into server, then run JS package manager command to install dependencies (e.g. "npm install").
-cd into client, then run JS package manager command to install dependencies (e.g. "npm install").

TO RUN:
-cd into server, then use JS package manger to run server.js (e.g. "npm server.js").
-cd into client, then use JS package manager to run start script (e.g. "npm start").
-NOTE: You need MongoDB to be running to be able to properly run the application. Please go to https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ to see how to properly install MongoDB for your OS.
